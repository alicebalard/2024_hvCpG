Neither -s (single-end) nor -p (paired-end) selected for deduplication. Trying to extract this information for each file separately from the @PG line of the SAM/BAM file

If there are several alignments to a single position in the genome the first alignment will be chosen. Since the input files are not in any way sorted this is a near-enough random selection of reads.
