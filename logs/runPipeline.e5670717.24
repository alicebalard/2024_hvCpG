Proceeding with single-core trimming (user-defined)
Path to Cutadapt set as: '/share/apps/genomics/cutadapt-2.5/bin/cutadapt' (user defined)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command '/share/apps/genomics/cutadapt-2.5/bin/cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 2.4
single-core operation.
No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /SAN/ghlab/epigen/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/TEMP/01Trimmed_data/


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /SAN/ghlab/epigen/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/00RawFastq/dataset3/SRR15046852_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	54232	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	5.42
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 54232). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)


SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: /SAN/ghlab/epigen/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/00RawFastq/dataset3/SRR15046852_1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.7
Cutadapt version: 2.4
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
All sequences will be trimmed by 1 bp on their 3' end to avoid problems with invalid paired-end alignments with Bowtie 1
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 2.4). Setting -j 1
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to SRR15046852_1_trimmed.fq.gz
