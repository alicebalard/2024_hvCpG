Path to Cutadapt set as: '/share/apps/genomics/cutadapt-2.5/bin/cutadapt' (user defined)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command '/share/apps/genomics/cutadapt-2.5/bin/cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 2.4
Cutadapt seems to be using Python 3! Proceeding with multi-core enabled Cutadapt using 4 cores
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 4 cores

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /SAN/ghlab/pophistory/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/TEMP/01Trimmed_data/
pigz: skipping: _1.fastq.gz does not exist
Input file '_1.fastq.gz' seems to be completely empty. Consider respecifying!

Bowtie 2 seems to be working fine (tested command '/share/apps/genomics/bowtie2-2.4.1/bowtie2 --version' [2.4.1])
Output format is BAM (default)
Alignments will be written out in BAM format. Samtools found here: '/share/apps/genomics/samtools-1.9/bin/samtools'
Reference genome folder provided is /SAN/ghlab/pophistory/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/GRCh38/	(absolute path is '/SAN/ghlab/pophistory/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/GRCh38/)'
FastQ format assumed (by default)

Neither -s (single-end) nor -p (paired-end) selected for deduplication. Trying to extract this information for each file separately from the @PG line of the SAM/BAM file
Processing single-end Bismark output file(s) (SAM format):
/SAN/ghlab/pophistory/Alice/hvCpG_project/data/WGBS_human/TEMP/02Bismark/_pe.bam


If there are several alignments to a single position in the genome the first alignment will be chosen. Since the input files are not in any way sorted this is a near-enough random selection of reads.
